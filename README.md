# Image-Classification-with-Vision-Transformer


This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification, using the CIFAR-100 dataset. The ViT model applies the Transformer architecture, typically used for natural language processing, to image classification by treating images as sequences of patches and using self-attention mechanisms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this experiment, you will:
- Understand the Vision Transformer (ViT) model architecture.
- Learn how to create sequences of image patches to feed into the ViT model.
- Perform image classification using the ViT model on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

## Introduction

The Vision Transformer (ViT) model, created by Alexey Dosovitskiy and others, represents a novel approach to image classification. This model adapts the Transformer architecture for use with images by dividing them into patches and processing these patches with self-attention mechanisms. This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of ViT on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

### Requirements

- TensorFlow 2.4 or higher
- TensorFlow Addons

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -U tensorflow-addons
```

## Data Description

**CIFAR-100 Dataset:**
- **Training Images**: 50,000 images (500 per class)
- **Testing Images**: 10,000 images (100 per class)
- **Image Size**: 32x32 color images
- **Number of Classes**: 100 fine-grained classes grouped into 20 superclasses.

Each image is labeled with both a "fine" label (specific class) and a "coarse" label (superclass), providing a rich dataset for hierarchical image classification.
